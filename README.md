# R and Jupyter
Simple Jupyter Notebook with R running in docker

## Getting Started
### on Windows
### on Mac
//todo
clone repo
build
run
open

## Updating the environment

## Is this really the best tool for R notebooks?
* Perhaps [R Notebooks](https://minimaxir.com/2017/06/r-notebooks/) are better than Jupyter Notebooks for R.
* Perhaps you don't need to manage docker locally and instead can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
